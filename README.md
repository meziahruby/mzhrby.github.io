# Hi, my name is Meziah Ruby. Nice to meet you!
I work full-time as a User Experience Engineer for Cisco, developing accessible, reusable common components for Cisco CX and PX platforms. Prior to working for Cisco, I was an undergrad student at UC Davis, where I majored in Computer Science (B.S.), minored in Communications, and fell in love with design thinking.
