# Hi, my name is Meziah. Nice to meet you!
I design and build software solutions for Cisco by combining my degree in Computer Science with my experience in human-centered design.
When I'm not working, I like to travel and keep a visual diary on Instagram. I also like sharing my thoughts and stories about life, career growth, and personal development on Medium.
