# Hi, my name is Meziah Ruby. Nice to meet you!
I work full-time as a Software Engineer for Cisco, developing across the stack for an internal platform in Commerce IT. Prior to working for Cisco, I was an undergrad student at UC Davis, where I majored in Computer Science (B.S.), minored in Communications, and fell in love with design thinking.
