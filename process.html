                <h3>The work before I work</h3>
                My work process begins with a notebook entry: I like to write out a project's goals and needs first because it helps me figure out if I know enough to get started, or if I need more discussions (usually with the IT Analyst handing me requirements).<br>
            <br>

                            <p class="small">Work projects go in this A5 Muji notebook (which conveniently opens flat and comes in a pack of 5). I keep this at my desk and stick my today's to-do list on top of it. (I don't bother with work planners anymore because most days don't go as scheduled. Instead, I set my top priorities and do my best to accomplish those.)</p>

                    Then I like to brainstorm a list of what's needed. This helps me identify dependencies and any lingering questions I still have about the project. It's also a great segue into task writing. My current team is "agile-fall"; we're not a full-fledged sprint team, but we do follow some scrum methodologies, like dev cycles and User Stories.<br>
                    <br>
                    Once I have the goals, needs, and a rough idea of execution, I write my tasks and estimate my hours against the user story in Rally.<br>

            <h3>How I approach prototyping</h3>
            <img style="margin-bottom: 1vh" src="assets/process-prototype.png">
            If I'm in charge of the mockups, I start with paper first. These are rough sketches that I love to use in discussions. One of my favorite parts of the process is when I bring these to the IT Analyst's desk and we annotate them together. I truly feel some of my best work happens in those 5-10 minute discussions where ideas are just bouncing off one another.<br>
            <br>
            It's only after I've vetted the paper mockups before I even considering make them digital (usually with Sketch) These are the prototypes that we share with our business stakeholders/users. The IT Analyst handles most of the feedback gathering at this point (because I'm technically just a software engineer), so I just get debriefed later.<br>
            <br>
            When there's changes to be done (which is always): I print out and annotate the digital mockups and get them vetted by the IT Analyst again before I polish the prototypes for developer handoff.<br>
            <br>
            If I'm only providing feedback on mockups/protoypes (when the project employs UI design contractors): I annotate them using my iPad + Apple Pencil and send additional notes in the email body. For more "intense" feedback (which happens really rarely) or when I'm asked to give my rough idea for the UI/UX, I draw digital mockups (making full use of the shapes feature in Notability) and have a follow-up meeting with the IT Analyst in charge of the scope (they're also responsible for discussing the work with contractors).<br>
            <br>
            <p class="small">
                A quick note about the sustainability factor of my process: I know that my ideal process is paper-intense, but I promise I use these resources well! When they've served their purpose as discussion tools, I use them as a reference when I'm coding. I also use the back of these pages as scratch paper (usually for mockups) before placing them in paper recycling bins.<br>
                <br>
                Cisco also uses recycled paper in its printers so that's one less thing to feel bad about!<br>

            <h3>How I code (aka "How I earn my software engineer pay")</h3>

            <br>
            My work was starting to shift from Full Stack to Front-End when I filmed this video. Most of my coding process hasn't changed since then.<br>
            <br>
            The only (albeit big) difference is that my day now includes some UI/UX work. My team has recognized my passion for design thinking and UI/UX, so part of my time is dedicated to being the acting UI/UX Lead.<br>
            <br>
            But, in case you don't have 10 minutes to spare, here's highlights from the video:<br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>I usually get to the office between 9:30 and 10am.</li>
                <li>I start every work day by doing a git pull so I'll always have the latest version of our platform before I do any changes. (I work a lot with teammates in India so I make sure to do this before anything else.)</li>
                <li>While my IDE's are refreshing, I check my work email and reply to as many as I can until around 10:30am. I don't check my emails again until later in the afternoon.</li>
                <li>Before coding, I check my notebook to see where I left off in the previous work day. From there, I decide my priorities for the day and code until I take a lunch break around noon.</li>
                <li>My meetings (if I have any at all) are usually early afternoon, so I like to time my lunch as close to those as possible so I minimize the time I switch contexts.</li>
                <li>I ease back into coding by checking my notebook again.</li>
                <li>I try to take a walking break everywhere, but I do it especially when I feel myself hitting a road block. I just walk around the floor and say hi to co-workers I pass by.</li>
                <li>I leave the office somewhere between 5 to 5:30pm and am usually done with work for the day by then, except for when I have night meetings (like the India-friendly standup).
